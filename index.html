                    My name is Mei Yi (Faye). I am currently studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. Before taking this program, I had been working in the event industry for a few years. Working as an event agent was just like an intermediary between different parties, and it is all about people interaction. I believe that I can gain practical knowledge and innovative insights during my study. After graduating, I hope to become a digital content creator.

                    Although I am an introvert, I really enjoy the outdoor winter activities such as snowboarding, ice skating, and snowshoeing. Besides, I am a big fan of snowboarding. A few years ago, I went to Japan for a working holiday and had been working in a ski resort. The main reason for working there was that I can get a free season pass and take complimentary lessons with professional instructors as a perk for the job.
